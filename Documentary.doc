Architectures which have been successful in Computer Vision domain.
ImageNet - Database for ILSVR (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition) challenge.



Alexnet – First deep neural network (Starting point for Image/Audio recognition purposes)
Pooling is a concept in deep learning visual object recognition that goes hand-in-hand with convolution. The idea is that a convolution (or a local neural networkfeature detector) maps a region of an image to a feature map.
The softmax function is used in various multiclass classification methods, such as multinomial logistic regression (also known assoftmax regression) [1], multiclass linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes classifiers, and artificial neural networks.
GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

Here both Generator and Discriminator get smart over the time. Each part gets better at pattern recognition. Think of all the useful applications. Gmaps genertaion etc
Analogy:    Investigator and forger example
